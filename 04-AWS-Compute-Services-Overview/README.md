Compute services are the backbone that power most web-based applications. They are the foundation on which many Amazon Web Services (AWS) offerings are built. This course provides a high-level overview of the three main categories of compute services on AWS:

Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2)
Containers, which include Amazon Elastic Container Service (Amazon ECS) and Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (Amazon EKS)
Serverless (AWS Lambda)
This course includes a use case scenario to help you learn how to differentiate between the different compute options and how to select the best compute option for a given workload.

Course level: Foundational
Duration: 40 minutes

# Activities

This course includes interactive lessons and knowledge check questions.
